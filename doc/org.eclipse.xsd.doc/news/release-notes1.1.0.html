           The xsd2ecore plugins (org.eclipse.emf.mapping.xsd2ecore and org.eclipse.emf.mapping.xsd2ecore.editor) have been added.  They illustrate how to use the mapping framework, and the editor can be used to view the mapping produced during XSD to Ecore conversion.  Documentation will be forthcoming soon.

          <ul>
            <li>                
             XSD_ENCODING is now supported as an option for specifying the encoding for XSD resources.
            </li>
            <li>
             The visibility of the isTypeDerivedFrom method in the XSDSchemaQueryTools class has been changed from protected to public.  
             (Bugzilla <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36062">36062</a>)
            </li>
            <li>
             The XSD to Ecore conversion utilities have been moved to org.eclipse.xsd.ecore in the org.eclipse.xsd plugin for more flexible reuse.

          <ul>
            <li>                
             In order to have value objects that implement equals() correctly, values of simple types based on int[] and byte[] in Xerces need to be wrapped.  Therefore, the types:
              <ul>	
               <li>
                 org.eclipse.xsd.types.XSDAnySimpleType.IntSequence and
               </li>
               <li>
                 org.eclipse.xsd.types.XSDAnySimpleType.ByteSequence 
               </li>
              </ul>
              will be used in place of int[] and byte[], respectively.  (Later versions of Xerces have their own wrapper type which we will use when we switch to a newer version.)
            </li>
            <li>
            We have refreshed the cached version of XMLSchema.xsd to the latest version on the web in order to pick up the errata changes to that version.

            <li>
             The xsd2ecore mapping has been changed to map an XSD ID-type attribute as an ID EAttribute.

            <li>
             The xsd2ecore mapping has been updated to handle abstract elements and substitution groups.

            The getEClassifier(XSDTypeDefinition xsdTypeDefinition, boolean supportNull) method in the org.eclipse.xsd.ecore.XSDEcoreBuilder.java class has been updated to ensure that an XSD abstract complex type becomes an abstract EClass.

            The getBadTypeDerivation(XSDTypeDefinition xsdTypeDefinition, boolean extension, boolean restriction) method in the org.eclipse.xsd.impl.XSDSimpleTypeDefintionImpl.java class has been updated because a simple type needs to be considered to be derived from complex anyType.
