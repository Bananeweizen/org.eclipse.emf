          <b>Validation Support</b>
          <p>
            A schema can be validated to determine whether it is a fully valid instance according to the 1.0 specification;
            since this had been working for several months, it isn't really all that new.

          <b>Documentation Plugin</b>
          <p>
            There is now a documentation plugin, org.eclipse.xsd.doc,
            included in the download. All the XSD documentation is now
            available from the desktop Help menu. We've put the documentation
            plugin into the Runtime zip file, so its download size has increased.
            We're thinking about moving it into the Source zip,
            or maybe into its own zip file, in the future. If you have an
            opinion, please feel free to post it to the XSD newsgroup.
